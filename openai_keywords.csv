0_bj,Ilovebennjerry,4/15/2017,3,Not enough brownies!,10,3,"Super good, don't get me wrong. But I came for the caramel and brownies, not the sweet cream. The packaging made it seem like brownies were packed and bountiful *crying frowny emoji* I'd say the taste of this was amazing, but the ratio of brownie to sweet cream was disappointing. Liked it regardless but probably won't buy again simply because it didn't live up to its promising package. I'll find another one that has a better ratio and wayyy more yummy chewy brownies.
Overall, good flavor, texture, idea, and brownies. Not so great caramel/sweet cream/ brownie RATIO. Just add more brownies. Please.",Neutral,"caramel,brownies,sweet cream,packaging,taste,ratio,yummy,texture,idea,caramel,sweet cream,brownie ratio"

Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness.",Positive,"caramel, brownies, pint, disappoint, brownie chunk, fifth pint, daily pint, happiness"

The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind.",Negative,"salted caramel core, caramel, blonde bits, plentiful, sparse, flow"

I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does!

First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that’s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what’s really wrong. It’s disgusting and so salty it’s actually inedible. I’ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level.

Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel.

I'll go through at least half of the pint with just 1 or 2 chunks. It looks like plain ice cream with a salted caramel core. This has happened a lot lately, and it's so dissapointing. I've gotten to the point where I simply stopped buying it. Today, purchased two because they were on sale. It started the way it should be, with plenty of yummy chunks. Before I even got halfway as I was serving myself, no more chunks. After some digging around, I found 3 more way at the bottom. Please fix this!

I didn't really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didn't really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better).

In addition, I love anything caramel but the salted caramel core was so overbearing, I honestly don't know how this made it on to be a final flavor after the taste testers tried it.

0_bj,BJBLU,9/3/2019,3,Why aren’t the brownie bits chewy?,0,1,Hello. I just bought my 4th and 5th pints of salted caramel core while awaiting Hurricane Dorian to arrive. I will have to say that my son and I greatly enjoyed the first 3. Plenty of salty caramel (yum) and plenty of brownie bits that were chewy to the bite. However these last 2 pints that I just purchased do have plenty of caramel and brownie bits but they aren’t chewy. They are more crumbly to the bite. I’m not sure if the first 3 were a fluke or these last 2 weren’t right. Is the brownie supposed to be chewy or crumbly?

I initially was thinking of going for a strawberry or peach flavor, but then I saw this pint and had a double take. I'd never try this flavor prior and man, I do not regret it. I love this pint. I love sweet cream and blonde brownie so this was a win-win. I like how to salted caramel is in the center so I have the ability to control how much I want in each bite.

I started eating this ice cream and was transported to the first time I had gooey caramel pop corn... the ice cream was like eating sweet corn creamy and smooth and the chewy bits supposed to be brownie tasted like caramel pop corn that had gotten chewy and sweet soaked in ice cream.. then the salty caramel center was too good to even say but together the best caramel pop corn ice cream I have ever had.. even though I don’t know if that’s what they were going for lol.. my favorite flavor so far,Positive,"Ice cream, caramel popcorn, chewy brownie, salty caramel, caramel popcorn ice cream, favorite flavor"

It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint! Wow! And the caramel itself was delicious; salty sweet and gooey! The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely. My only issue was the blonde brownie bits. It’s not that they weren’t plentiful, I just really didn’t like the taste of them, which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER! The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren’t very good and I ate around them.

Sometimes there's a ton of salted caramel at the top which can be overwhelming and then it's gone half way down. Other times it's normal until you get about halfway and there nothing but the sweet cream ice cream with no caramel or brownies.

Peanut butter ice cream with pretzel swirls and brownie pieces—should be a hit. It is not. First, the peanut butter ice cream is WAY too salty. I agree some salt is needed to offset what could otherwise be a cloyingly sweet peanut butter flavor, but this kills any semblance of peanut butter flavor and is unnecessary given the pretzel swirls. Second, why pretzel swirls and not pieces or chunks? The swirls are weirdly soft and barely evoke the sense of eating a pretzel. Finally, the brownie chunks were just weird. They are the same ones as in Half Baked, where they work beautifully. Here, I respect the need to bring in a chocolate component with a peanut butter base, that’s a no-brainer. But why not go with fudge chunks or chips? The brownies brought no flavor to this pint and certainly did not help on texture.

The combo is heavenly. I've been waiting for years for Ben and Jerry's to bring back the potato chip ingredient and lo and behold yesterday at the store I found this flavor. It's even better than I remember late night snack being; the potato chip swirl provides a perfect salty and sweet combo in almost every bite.

Overall it takes like dipping fries into a Wendy’s Frosty. The chocolate flavor is AMAZING! However, I wasn’t a big fan of the chip “swirls”. It’s soft and doughy, but salty like a chip. The texture threw me off, and reminded me of salt dough. I wasn’t able to enjoy it. If they made just the chocolate flavor separately I would definitely buy it!

I love the sweet and salty combo, and I feel that the addition of the chocolate chunks are really what make this ice cream so unbelievably fantastic. And the chips -- they're in a swirl, they stay crunchy, and there's the perfect amount! The combination of textures and flavors is just amazing.
My only complaint is that this is a limited botch. Like the title of this review says, there will be tears from me if you get rid of this. This NEEDS to be a regular flavor, and I really hope this opens up the door for more sweet and salty flavors. Please don't get rid of this flavor!

2_bj,audrey the icecream lover,8/24/2020,5,MY FAVORITEST ICE CREAM EVAARRRRRRRR,0,0,"Dearest Ben and Jerry,
Chip Happens is the most divine ice cream flavor to ever grace this earth. Honestly, the way the potato chips looked on the packaging looked a little suspicious. BUT, I was BLOWN AWAY WHEN I TASTED THIS MASTERPIECE OF A FROZEN DESSERT. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. it is the PERFECT combination of sweet and salty. And just REALLY GOOD. In fact, I recommended it to a friend, who once said his favorite flavor was mint chip. BUT ONCE HE TASTED HE THE HEAVENLY TASTE OF CHIP HAPPENS, HE WAS converted as well. We ate so much ice cream for two weeks and put hot fudge on it. It was really a beautiful experience. I will forever hold these memories close to my heart. A month later, I returned to the grocery store scouring the shelves for my beloved ice cream. And to my horror, I could not find it. I even had a whole conversation with a lady at the grocery store employee about how distraught i was. I returned home, sad, hungry, and heartbroken, for my beloved ice cream had left. But, I will not rest until i can experience this ice cream flavor once more. I am calling on you Ben and Jerry, BRING BACK THIS ICE CREAM FLAVOR. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR STANDARD FLAVORS AND DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE BEAUTEOUS FOOD ITEM IT IS. I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE THAN TO TASTE THE SWEET GOODNESS OF CHIP HAPPENS.

To my surprise this flavor has quickly become my new fave! (Right under Half Baked) It seemed creamier than usual which I attribute to the marscapone. The cannoli pieces are delish and it is an overall pleasant experience. No clue why anyone would call it ""plain"" unless they were expecting the ice cream to be the flavor of the shell or something. If you are looking for something packed with flavor this one isn't for you. This flavor is meant to have when youre craving a more sophisticated dessert.

3_bj,ChrisColby,2/26/2020,5,Hopefully never discontinued again!,3,2,"A delicious take on the classic Italian dessert, B&J's Cannoli is a winner. The base is described as a marscapone flavor. Now marscapone isn't typically used for Cannolis but instead ricotta. Marscapone is a cream cheese used for cakes and other desserts. While not quite fitting the theme of a Cannoli in that regard, B&J made the right choice for the sake of flavor. The base is absolutely like a heightened cheesecake. Almost as if their regular cheesecake flavor was mixed with the equally delicious buttery brown sugar one. It's fantastic. The swirl is the same flavor, so they blend together seamlessly for a full on sweet cream cheese taste. And the pastry pieces are the perfect contrast to the base. Crunchy and covered in chocolate, they remind me of the similar chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces from Americone Dream, and there are plenty in each pint. Whether it fits the theme or not, Cannoli is a great flavor that I hope stays as a mainline one for a long time.",Positive,"Delicious, Classic Italian Dessert, Marscapone, Ricotta, Cheesecake, Buttery Brown Sugar, Sweet Cream Cheese, Chocolate, Crunchy, Pastry Pieces, Americone Dream, Cannoli"

With the first bite you can definitely taste a hint of marshmallow-y flavor in the base ice cream. It's different than just plain vanilla. I think they did a great job capturing that flavor. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham swirl is smart and I think it's a unique way to add the classic flavor of a smore. And of course, you can't go wrong with fudge flakes!

It was the most disappointing moment when I opened the pint to find chocolate ice cream instead of the typical golden ice cream I was used to with the Gimme S'more. Gimme S'more is the perfect representation of what a S'more is: mostly composed of perfectly toasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate, and a great trail of graham crackers.

They definitely should have had a soft fudge swirl or something instead. The graham crackers are the best part, but there just weren't enough.

Ben and Jerry's wisely made the decision to use a marshmallow base instead of chocolate, so it doesn't overpower the other components. The base tastes more like sweet cream than marshmallow but when combined with the fudge flakes and graham cracker, the result tastes very close to the real deal. My only complaints are that the chocolate cookie crumbs overpower what little graham cracker there is, losing the theme a little. And the fudge flakes are strangely limited.

I totally tasted the graham cracker pieces and I LOVE the chocolate cookies BJ puts in their ice-cream. If I had to make a critique or suggestion, I would say maybe have more graham cracker swirls and/or flavor the ice-cream graham cracker and have marshmallow swirls with the cookie and graham crackers? I don't know though because I'm pretty overkill with my ice-cream. If it doesn't sound like I'm going to die it wouldn't be my first choice.

Let me just start out by saying that smores is a hard flavor to really nail flavor wise. I really enjoyed the marshmallow ice cream. Alot of companies usually go with chocolate as a base for Smores and I think that its usually overwhelming and distracting from the marshmallow. So the star of the flavor show was definitely on point. The grahms are great and are a great topping used in alot of flavors lately.

The “marshmallow” ice cream is vanilla and there is no hint of graham cracker. The most overpowering part is the chocolate cookie swirl...which is not s’mores. Don’t get me wrong, the ice cream is good! If I were rating based on taste it would get 5 Stars. But I’m rating it based on how closely it captures the s’mores flavor.

5_bj,ChrisColby,2/26/2020,5,Peanut Butter makes everything better,10,1,"A flavor I'm glad to see back after liking it before it was discontinued, PB Half Baked is even better than I remembered. There's not much to say if youve already had the standard half baked. It works very similarly except that the vanilla portion of the flavor is now replaced with peanut butter ice cream, and the chocolate chip cookie dough is instead peanut butter cookie dough. For such slight changes though, they do make a big difference. One thing I disliked in the original half baked was how weak the vanilla base was and how it was completely dominated by the chocolate. That's not the case here as the peanut butter taste to the ice cream is strong enough to balance out the chocolate, giving the classic combination we know and love. The balance is also matched perfectly with the mix ins. There are HUGE brownie squares in this flavor, tasting great as always, and combined with the numerous peanut butter cookie dough pieces, you're getting the chocolate/peanut butter taste in every bite. If you're a fan of that flavor combination, you can't go wrong with Peanut Butter Half Baked.",Positive," Review, Peanut Butter Half Baked, Vanilla, Chocolate, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Peanut Butter Ice Cream, Brownie Squares, Peanut Butter Cookie Dough, Chocolate,Peanut Butter"

I left a few other people in the house have a small spoonful and they liked it as well. And to the person who said Strawberry Cheesecake is gone, you are wrong.

However, while the pint succeeded in taste, it fell short on execution (bad pun unintended, considering the name). The chocolate base was noticeably less dense than the cinnamon, and was riddled with tiny air bubbles. It still tasted great, but the creaminess was inconsistent, and likewise, there were plenty of dough gobs but only 3 big brownie chunks. Seems like Justice Remix'd just needed a a bit more balanced mixing.

If fear factor created an ice cream flavor, this would be it. None of the flavors work together. The cinnamon is too strong. Would be better if it tasted more like a cinnamon roll than the cinnamon challenge from a few years back. The spicy brownie makes no sense. The flavor is so off putting, i wanted to gag.

9_bj,Amanda530,8/23/2020,1,Good idea but weird,0,9,"I was excited to try this new flavor last week. What's not to love about fudge cows, toffee, and sugar cookie. Unfortunately for me it was a major flop. The ice cream and fudge cows were enjoyable. The toffee clusters were a weird texture experience, unfortunately. I was expecting something more along the lines of the toffee in Everything But The.... which I really enjoy. The real disappointment, and reason I'm actually taking the time to review ice cream, was the sugar cookie dough core. For me, it just tasted of wet sugar. Grainy, too soft, no flavor. Ben and Jerry's has set high expectations for their products, but sadly this one didn't deliver for me.",Negative," Ice cream, Fudge cows, Toffee, Sugar cookie, Everything But The, Sugar, Ben and Jerry's"

Got one for me and one for my wife, and we both thought it was fan-freaking-tastic. It even has a hint of malt flavor, whether unintentional or due to a confluence of other ingredients.

I pe this flavor because it is BY FAR the best tasting Ben and Jerry’s flavor ever made, no competition... and i amd a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan. The reason I hate it is because this flavor has caused me to gain like 30 lbs at this point because I cannot stop eating it. It does not get old. Ever. The crunchy sweetness of the toffee is spot on amd just pairs PERFECTLY with the sugar cookie core and the milk chocolate ice cream. Oh yeah, MILK CHOCOLATE. The milk chocolate is so good. I have eaten probably like 50 of these at this point and everytime the core is big and i never get a bad core. Every pint i have gotten has been just as good ig not better than the last.

I wanted to add a review since there was only one so far... To my surprise the cone was still crispy and the amount of fudge covering the cone was not overwhelming whatsoever. But the caramel swirl is fantastic quality, bringing back memories of the first time I had caramel with a side of Apple. I chose this because I was looking for a non traditional flavor but not too rich, now don't get me wrong, eating half a pint is definitely a hefty load on the gut but it doesn't feel too busy and you still get to enjoy the ice cream.",Positive," Ben and Jerry's  , Americone Dream , Crispy , Fudge , Caramel swirl , Apple , Non traditional flavor , Rich , Half a pint , Gut , Ice cream"
